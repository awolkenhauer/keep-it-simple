## Preparing for summer

### Recommend time frame: End of May

1. Turn the valve leading to the gas tank to the off position. (Some machines don't have a shutoff, in that case the tank/carburetor need to be drained)
2. Run the snowblower till it runs out of gas.
3. Add fuel stabilizer to the remaining fuel in the tank.
