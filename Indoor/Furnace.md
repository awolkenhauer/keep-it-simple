## Changing furnace filter

### Recommend time frame: Once a month

1. Locate the filter compartment. It is typically found between the return air duct and the furnace, then remove the old filter.
2. Unwrap the new filter from any plastic packaging
3. Place the new filter in the filter compartment.

### Notes: 
* To find the size of your systemâ€™s filter, slide the old filter out of the filter cabinet. Most filters have the dimensions printed on their frame in length x width x height format.
* A good time to change the filter is right after paying the home mortgage.
